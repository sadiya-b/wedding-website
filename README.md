# Note For TAs
1. Completed 3 features with all CRUD Operations.
2. Radio buttons might not be populated because of the synthetic data, top 20 records were manually added, they show how the functionality works.
3. Used render to deploy the code, but without using CORS, the backend wasn't connecting to front-end. 
4. Main branch is the branch i'm using for deployment. 
5. Local branch contains my code freeze minus readme, becauase i just updated it.
